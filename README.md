# 3D Model Website

Welcome to my **3D Model Website** where you can interact with a 3D model directly in your browser. This project uses **Three.js** to load and display 3D models with mouse controls for rotation, zoom, and panning.

## Features
- Displays a 3D model loaded from a **GLB** file.
- Supports **mouse interaction** using **OrbitControls**:
  - **Click and drag** to rotate the model.
  - **Scroll** to zoom in and out.
  - **Pan** around the model.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
